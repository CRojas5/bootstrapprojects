        <p class="lead">Hi My name is Cooper, I"m a 7 year old shih tzu with the personailty of a grumpy old man. Don't pet me unless I want you to pet me
          and don't even think about picking me up, oh no no no. I love Chipotle chicken and barking. In my spare time I sleep, sleep, poop, and
          then sleep some more. I enjoy going on walks but not too long of a walk. I've got an attitude but you can't help but love me anyways.</p>

        <p class="lead"> I have lots and like to leaving them everywhere and enoy making a huge mess. This pumpkin one is my favorite toy. 
          I know it's out of season but I love it. I don't like to share it with anyone. Once I get it, I won't give it back.. Unless
          you give me a treat because priorities (did someone say treat??) My toys, mine mine mine. Sharing is not caring. </p>

        <p class= "lead">This is me sleeping. I love sleeping, sleeping is my job. I have my own beds, one upstairs and one downstairs but I like to sleep on others people's bed even though
          I'm not allowed. I still do it because I'm cute and they can't say no to me. I sleep on my bed, this bed, and the sofa when my owners
          are out and about. That's what they get for leaving me alone all day.</p>

         <p class = "lead">I like to keep an eye out of things because you never know what or who is going to walk by the window. Once I see something or nothing
           at all sometimes I bark like no tomorrow, woof woof woof. I bark a lot when I see guys or when I hear a guy cough, ooo that gets me all riled up.
           They try and block my view with pillows, and objects. But nothing can stop me from barking, wooof woof woof. Don't make any
           coughing noises around here or you're gonna get it. WOOF.</p>

           <p class = "lead"> I'm a very cute dog once you get to know me. I have a underbite that I think adds to my personality. This is me dressed up 
          like a hotdog! (I hated it) but it was my birthday day. Yes, I was born on Hallooween. I'm grey and white. I also sometimes trip 
          people since I get in the way and don't care. Don't trip on me though, I'll fight you even though it's my fault. I have
          deep brown eyes, makes the ladies love me. Fact: my favorite scratching spot is my back. I'm cute and fluffy, the end.</p>
